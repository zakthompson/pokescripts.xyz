# Pokemon Scripts for Arduino

## Introduction
Since the Nintendo Switch now supports USB controllers, some enterprising individuals reverse-engineered the Pokken Tournament Pro Pad firmware for use on microcontrollers. This repository contains a collection of scripts which execute input loops on the controller that allow for automating repetitive tasks in Pokemon Sword & Shield, such as hosting raids and hatching eggs. Additionally, it provides a web-based tool for generating and downloading precompiled hex files for these various scripts. Check it out at https://pokescripts.xyz

## Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull-request with a clear explanation of what improvement you are adding. I will review it as quickly as I can.

## Credits
The scripts themselves originate from various people, and have been tweaked, modified and optimized along the way. As more contribute, I'll try and keep this list up-to-date.
