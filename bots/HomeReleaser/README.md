# Instructions

1. This script deletes 3 boxes at a time becaue of the release limit.
2. Remove all wanted Pokemon from 3 consecutive boxes.
3. Ensure there is a Pokemon at the **top left corner** of each box. There can be empty spots in other places in the box, just not the first slot.
4. Set your cursor to the red one and hover it over the first Pokemon.
5. Plug in the bot to mass release quickly.

### Notes:
This is much faster than releasing your Pokemon in the actual game. Good for clearing your boxes after mass egg hatching.
The bot will release everything in your box and save. Use with caution and ensure you have everything you want to keep removed from 3 boxes!
